##Taking your time, you slowly climb the staircase towards the source of the light. As you ascend you hear something like gears moving around you.

###You turn around to see nothing but a wooden wall behind you where the stairs and door used to be. Going up only seems to make the wall advance along with you. With no where else to go you continue going up the stairs that seem to never end.
###At the end of the staircase you reach what seems to be a blue screen with two buttons underneath it. You read what's writen on the screen.

###**"Choose wisely, for your choice determines the if you live or die."**

###As you finish reading the text, the two buttons light up a bright red with black text upon them:

##[Loved One](../r-door_con/loved_one.md)
##[Yourself](../r-door_con/yourself.md)
