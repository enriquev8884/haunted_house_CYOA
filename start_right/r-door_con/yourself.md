##The screen suddenly goes black throwing you into darkness. A sudden scream comes from behind the walls, followed by the noise of a gunshot...and then silence.

##Not more then a couple seconds after you hear something click. What once was a wall next to you creaks open and you see a light piercing through. With all your might, you push on the door. It takes you a while to adjust to the light but you step out either way, the secret door closing behind you.

###The truth of where you are creeps on you. Looking around you see nothing but grass and trees, noticing as well that wherever you just came from has just disappeared.
